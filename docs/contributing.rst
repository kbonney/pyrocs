============

Thank you for wanting to contribute to this library! We will try to make this 
an easy process for you. If you are looking to contribute code, we recommended that you read 
the :ref:`development<development>` page.

the acceptance of your PR.

Issues and bug reporting
------------------------

To report issues or bugs please create a new issue on 
the `pyrocs issues page <https://github.com/sandialabs/pyrocs/issues>`_.
Before submitting your bug report, please perform a cursory search 
to see if the problem has been already reported. If it has been reported, 
and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new issue.

  the behavior you observed after following the steps, and the expected behavior.

- If possible, provide a simple example of the bug using pyrocs example data.

- When relevant, provide information on your computing environment
  (operating system, python version, pyrocs version or commit).

- For runtime errors, provide a function call stack.
