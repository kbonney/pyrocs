Installation
===============

We recommend using a virtual environment when installing pyrocs. 
`Conda<https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>` is a popular option for
virtual environment management.
Regular tests are run for pyrocs on Python versions 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11 so we recommend installing 
the package alongside one of these Python versions, although pyrocs may work with other versions as well.

The latest release of pyrocs is accessible via PYPI using the following
command line prompt::

    $ pip install pyrocs

Alternatively, the package can be installed using github::

    $ git clone https://github.com/sandialabs/pyrocs.git
    $ cd pyrocs
    $ pip install .
