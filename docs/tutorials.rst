The functions within pyRoCS can be applied to either empirical datasets or simulation environments. 
For example, they can be used to compare a dataset with a subset to characterize how 
representativeness the former is of the latter (Tutorial #1). The functions can 
also be used to characterize layout of organizations (Tutorial #2). More details about the 
implementation of the functions as well as possible implications of the findings are 
captured in the below tutorials.
