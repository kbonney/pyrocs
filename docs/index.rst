Overview
============
The purpose of pyRoCS is to support characterization, evaluation, and learning to inform 
improvements in complex systems. Specifically, the focus on resilience draws attention 
to the ability of a complex system to withstand, operate through, and recover from a 
disruption. The complex system may be a physical system such as an electric grid, 
an organization such as a company, or even a subfunction of an organization. Existing 
mathematical equations for resilience analysis are found within multiple domains including 
information theory, biological sciences, and complex systems. This package synthesizes and 
refactors equations from these various domains to generalize their implementations in a 
Python environment. 

To get started, we recommend exploring the pyrocs :ref:`tutorials<tutorials>`.

The :ref:`API documentation<apidoc>` provides additional details about the functions included in the package.
